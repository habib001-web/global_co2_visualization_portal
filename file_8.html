### File Descriptions

- **index.html**: Single-page application with embedded JavaScript and CSS. Fetches live data from NOAA, renders Chart.js visualization, and handles user interactions.

- **data.json**: Contains calculated statistics (max, min, average) from the filtered dataset. Used to populate the statistics cards quickly without processing the entire dataset.

- **fetch_data.py**: Standalone Python script that demonstrates data processing logic. Fetches raw JSON from NOAA, filters records, calculates statistics, and saves to `data.json`.

- **uid.txt**: Unique project identifier for tracking and verification.

- **LICENSE**: Standard MIT License granting permissions for use, modification, and distribution.

## Data Source

This project uses data from:
- **Provider**: NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory
- **Dataset**: Mauna Loa CO₂ Monthly Mean
- **URL**: https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.json
- **Update Frequency**: Monthly

The Mauna Loa Observatory has been measuring atmospheric CO₂ since 1958, providing the longest continuous record of direct atmospheric CO₂ measurements in the world.

## Technical Details

### Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6 support
- Canvas API for Chart.js rendering
- Fetch API for data retrieval
- URLSearchParams for query string handling

### Performance

- Efficient client-side filtering (no page reloads)
- Chart updates use Chart.js destroy/recreate pattern
- Minimal DOM manipulation
- Responsive canvas rendering
