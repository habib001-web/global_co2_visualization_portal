This will:
- Fetch the latest data from NOAA
- Filter records from 2010 onwards
- Calculate statistics
- Generate yearly moving average data
- Save results to `data.json`

## Usage Guide

### Viewing the Interactive Dashboard

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
   - Double-click the file, or
   - Right-click ‚Üí Open with ‚Üí Your Browser, or
   - Serve via a local web server (recommended for best results)

2. The page will display:
   - Dataset title in the page header
   - Theme toggle button (dark/light mode)
   - Three statistics cards showing max, min, and average CO‚ÇÇ levels
   - An interactive line chart of CO‚ÇÇ concentration over time
   - A year filter dropdown
   - A comprehensive summary statistics table

### Using the Theme Toggle

- Click the **üåô Dark Mode** / **‚òÄÔ∏è Light Mode** button in the header
- Your preference is automatically saved in browser storage
- The theme persists across page reloads
- All charts and visualizations update dynamically

### Filtering Data

- **Use the dropdown**: Select any year from the "Filter by Year" dropdown to view data for that specific year
- **Use URL parameters**: Navigate to `index.html?year=2022` to automatically filter to 2022
- **View all data**: Select "All Years (2010+)" to see the complete dataset with the 5-year moving average trendline

### Understanding the Visualizations

#### Line Chart
- **Blue/Purple Line**: Raw monthly CO‚ÇÇ measurements
- **Pink/Cyan Line**: 5-year moving average (visible only when "All Years" is selected)
- **Interactive**: Hover over data points for detailed information

#### Summary Table
- **Year**: Calendar year
- **Maximum**: Highest monthly CO‚ÇÇ reading for that year
- **Minimum**: Lowest monthly CO‚ÇÇ reading for that year
- **Average**: Mean CO‚ÇÇ concentration for that year

### Understanding the Data

- **Values**: CO‚ÇÇ concentration measured in parts per million (ppm)
- **Time Range**: Monthly measurements from January 2010 to present
- **Source**: Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii (NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory)
- **Moving Average**: Calculated using a 60-month (5-year) rolling window

## Code Structure

### File Descriptions

  - Real-time data fetching from NOAA API
  - Interactive Chart.js visualization with dual datasets
  - Dark/light theme toggle with localStorage persistence
  - Dynamic year filtering and URL parameter handling
  - Responsive summary statistics table

- **data.json**: Contains calculated statistics and pre-processed data:
  - Max, min, and average CO‚ÇÇ values
  - Yearly moving average dataset
  - Used to populate statistics cards and initialize visualizations

- **fetch_data.py**: Standalone Python script for data processing:
  - Fetches raw JSON from NOAA API
  - Filters records from 2010 onwards
  - Calculates comprehensive statistics
  - Generates moving average data points
  - Saves to `data.json`

- **uid.txt**: Unique project identifier for tracking and verification

- **LICENSE**: Standard MIT License granting permissions for use, modification, and distribution

## Data Source

This project uses data from:
- **Provider**: NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory
- **Dataset**: Mauna Loa CO‚ÇÇ Monthly Mean
- **URL**: https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.json
- **Update Frequency**: Monthly

The Mauna Loa Observatory has been measuring atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ since 1958, providing the longest continuous record of direct atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ measurements in the world.

## Technical Details

### Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6 support
- Canvas API for Chart.js rendering
- Fetch API for data retrieval
- URLSearchParams for query string handling
- localStorage for theme persistence

### Performance

- Efficient client-side filtering (no page reloads)
- Chart updates use Chart.js destroy/recreate pattern
- Minimal DOM manipulation
- Responsive canvas rendering
- Theme-aware dynamic color schemes

### Data Processing

- **Moving Average Calculation**: 60-month rolling window for 5-year average
- **Statistical Analysis**: Real-time calculation of yearly min/max/avg values
- **Data Filtering**: Client-side year filtering with instant updates

## New Features Summary (Round 2)

1. **5-Year Moving Average**
   - Computed from filtered CO‚ÇÇ data (2010+)
   - Displayed as smooth secondary line on chart
   - Visible when "All Years" filter is selected
   - Legend distinguishes raw data from moving average

2. **Summary Statistics Table**
   - Dynamically populated after data fetch
   - Shows Year, Max, Min, Average for each year
   - Responsive design with hover effects
   - Theme-aware styling

3. **Enhanced Year Filter**
   - "All Years (2010+)" option as default
   - Displays full dataset with moving average
   - Preserves existing URL parameter functionality

4. **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**
   - Button in header for easy access
   - Saves preference in localStorage
   - Applies theme on page reload
   - Updates all UI elements and charts dynamically
